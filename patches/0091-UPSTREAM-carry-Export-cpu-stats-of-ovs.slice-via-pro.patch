Subject: [PATCH] UPSTREAM: <carry>: Export cpu stats of ovs.slice via
 prometheus

When a PerformanceProfile configures a node for cpu partitioning,
it also lets OVS use all the cpus available to burstable pods.
To be able to do that, OVS was moved to its own slice and that
slice needs to be re-added to cAdvisor for monitoring purposes.
